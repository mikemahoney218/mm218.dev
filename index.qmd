## Bio

I’m a PhD candidate at SUNY-ESF, working on predictive modeling and 
visualization with a focus on natural systems. 
My current work focuses on using game engines as GIS to visualize large-scale 
landscapes with a focus on forested systems as a method for scientific 
communication and outreach. 
Past projects have focused on landscape and community ecology, and have included 
predictive models of forest biomass from remote sensing data
and the landscape-level impacts of beaver within New York's Adirondack State Park.
In all of these projects I've worked to apply data science techniques 
to large-scale challenges, frequently serving as the statistical and technical 
expert within my team.

On this site I keep a list of [my publications](papers), [presentations](talks), 
and [my CV](cv.pdf), as well as a [technical blog](blog.html).
