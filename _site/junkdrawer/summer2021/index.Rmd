## CAFRI

### LiDAR-Year AGB

+ Boosted ensemble
+ Potentially, methods note on ensembling methods (in which case I'd want to include a bagged ensemble as well)
+ Add in the missing 30ish plots
+ Otherwise, unless we have more observations or are willing to compute more predictors, I think this is pretty well set

### Historic AGB

+ Historic AGB map accuracy pipeline
+ I think it makes sense for me to start getting more involved with this end, & give historical models the attention I've given the LiDAR-year set. But I haven't been particularly involved before, I don't know what this entails beyond:
	+ Work with non-WWE sets
	+ Include more predictors
	+ Ensembling

### Infrastructure

+ Break up model building notebook into functions; probably its own package

### Other

+ Carbon Accounting Tool


## Dissertation Research

+ Write proposal
+ terrain-into-Unity pipeline
+ Place arbitrary object pipeline
+ Stretch goal: chapter 1 (On Abstraction)
+ Stretch goal: chapter 2 (survey of environmental visualization)


## ML Course

+ Write course handouts
+ Write assignments


## Personal

+ No plans yet but going to try to disappear into the woods for a week if I can swing it
