This is an R Markdown document containing code for the workshop "Accessing the 
USGS National Map and making 3D maps with terrainr", held virtually on 
2021-05-28. If you want to follow along with the workshop as we go, 
[click this link to download the R Markdown notebook](https://mikemahoney218.github.io/2021-05-28-CDI-terrainr/2021-05-28-terrainr-workshop.Rmd).

If you're not familiar with R Markdown, this document lets us write both plain
text and code in a single document. Document sections inside three ` marks are
called "code chunks":

```{r}
plot(Orange)
```

A single line in a code chunk can be run by pressing Control+Enter with your
cursor on the line. The entire chunk can be run by pressing Control+Shift+Enter
with your cursor inside the chunk.

# Part 1: Installing Packages

For this workshop, we first need to install the packages that we'll be using.
This chunk will install any missing packages, and then load them all:

```{r}
if (!require("sf")) install.packages("sf")
if (!require("terrainr")) install.packages("terrainr")
if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require("scico")) install.packages("scico")
if (!require("raster")) install.packages("raster")
if (!require("progressr")) install.packages("progressr")
if (!require("progress")) install.packages("progress")
if (!require("tiff")) install.packages('tiff')

library("sf")
library("terrainr")
library("ggplot2")
library("scico")
library("raster")
library("progressr")
handlers("progress")
```

# Part 2: Retrieving Data

Up next, let's download some data! For the purposes of today's workshop, we'll 
work with campsite locations within Bryce Canyon National Park. We can download
this data from the National Park Service using the read_sf function from `sf`:

```{r}
campsites <- read_sf("https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/06993a2f20bf42d382c8ce6bd54027c4_0.geojson")
```

This dataset can be found online at https://public-nps.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bryce-canyon-national-park-backcountry-campsites-?geometry=-112.494%2C37.471%2C-111.908%2C37.566

We now have an `sf` object containing a handful of campsite locations! We can
plot our data using `ggplot2` to get a sense of what the spatial distribution of
the campsites looks like:

```{r}
ggplot(campsites) + 
  geom_sf(shape = 4, color = "red") + 
  theme_void()
```

This is the area we want to download data for from the National Map. Note that
everything we do from here on out works with pretty much any `sf` object; for
instance, the terrainr documentation (at https://docs.ropensci.org/terrainr/) 
often starts with a single latitiude/longitude point and then works from there.

By default, terrainr will download data for the bounding box of whatever `sf`
object you provide it. That is, data will only be downloaded for the smallest
rectangle of area that includes your entire `sf` object. 

In this case, we want a little bit of a buffer around our campsite locations so 
that our points aren't at the exact edge of the map. To make that happen, we can
use `set_bbox_side_length` to specifically control how much data to download. In
this case, a 16 kilometer side length works pretty well:

```{r}
campsite_bbox <- set_bbox_side_length(campsites, 16, "km")
```

We can add this to our plot to make sure we're giving a good buffer to our 
furthest points:

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = st_set_crs(campsite_bbox, 4326), color = "black", fill = NA) + 
  geom_sf(data = campsites, shape = 4, color = "red") + 
  theme_void()
```

Since all of our points fall comfortably within this box, we can use it to 
download our data. We'll use the `get_tiles` function to query the National Map
to download elevation data (from the USGS 3D Elevation Program DEM) and 
orthoimagery (from the USDA National Agricultural Imagery Program). This 
function will break our query into smaller parts and then save the tiles as 
separate files; we can control where the files get saved by using the 
`output_prefix` argument.

We'll wrap this query in the `with_progress` function in order to have a 
progress bar display while our data downloads. While for the purposes of this 
workshop we'll be downloading 30 meter rasters, which download pretty quickly 
(and only require one tile per type of data), this can be very useful for 
monitoring downloads when using higher-resolution data.

```{r}
with_progress(
  output_tiles <- get_tiles(campsite_bbox, 
                            output_prefix = "bryce_canyon_np_30m",
                            services = c("elevation", "ortho"),
                            resolution = 30)
)
```

By assigning the output from `get_tiles` to `output_tiles`, we create a list of
all of the map tiles we've downloaded:

```{r}
output_tiles
```

# Part 3: Plotting Data

This can be really helpful when trying to work with these files inside R. For 
instance, to see our elevation raster, we can plot our data easily enough using 
functions from `ggplot2`. First, we'll load the raster, then convert it to a 
data frame:

```{r}
elevation <- raster(output_tiles$elevation)
elevation <- as.data.frame(elevation, xy = TRUE)
names(elevation) <- c("x", "y", "z")
```

And then plot the data using `geom_raster`:

```{r}
ggplot(elevation, aes(x, y, fill = z)) +
  geom_raster() + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = terrain.colors(255)) + 
  coord_sf(crs = 4326) + 
  theme_void()
```

Plotting our orthoimagery is a bit of a different process; `ggplot2` doesn't by
default have a great way to handle these multi-band rasters. This time, we 
need to use a new function from `terrainr` called `geom_spatial_rgb`:

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_spatial_rgb(data = output_tiles$ortho,
                   mapping = aes(x, y, r = red, g = green, b = blue)) + 
  coord_sf(crs = 4326) + 
  theme_void()
```

Notice we don't need to convert our data to a data frame, like we did with 
elevation. When plotting basemaps with `geom_spatial_rgb`, you can provide 
`RasterStack` objects created by `stack`, or data frames, or file paths to 
the images you want to load. 

Using `ggplot2` makes it a lot easier to, for instance, plot our campsites on
top of a base map:

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_spatial_rgb(data = output_tiles$ortho,
                   mapping = aes(x, y, r = red, g = green, b = blue)) + 
  geom_sf(data = campsites, shape = 4, color = "red") + 
  coord_sf(crs = 4326) + 
  theme_void()
```

We can then continue to edit this map just like we would any other ggplot.

terrainr also provides a few options for editing our basemaps. If we want to, 
for instance, add our campsites to the orthoimagery, we can first create 
a new image from our campsite locations:

```{r}
vector_to_overlay(
  campsites,
  output_tiles$ortho,
  "campsite_overlay.png",
  shape = 4,
  color = "red"
)
```

To combine this new image with our orthoimagery, we'll want to use the 
`combine_overlays` function:

```{r}
combine_overlays(
  output_tiles$ortho,
  "campsite_overlay.png",
  output_file = "campsites_ortho.png"
)
```

This function "stacks" images, putting the first image in the set at the bottom
of the pile and the last image on the top. As a result, we now have our campsite
locations on top of our orthoimagery, as a single image:

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_spatial_rgb(data = "campsites_ortho.png",
                   mapping = aes(x, y, r = red, g = green, b = blue)) + 
  theme_void() + 
  coord_fixed()
```

This process is particularly useful for combining multiple map tiles from the 
National Map into a single basemap, allowing you to overlay roads, rivers, and 
more on orthoimagery.

## Example 

Now that we've seen a basic workflow using terrainr to pull layers from the National Map and plot with ggplot2, let's have some fun with it! Starting with the latitude and longitude coordinates for a new site, we'll create an sf object and add a spatial buffer around it like before.

```{r}
# yosemite NP
site <- data.frame(lat = 37.7456, lng = -119.5521)

# convert to sf object and assign coordinate reference system 
site_sf <- st_as_sf(site, coords = c("lng","lat"), crs = 4326)

# buffer around point
site_bbox <- set_bbox_side_length(site_sf, 10, "km")
```

Now, to pull some data using terrainr. In the previous example we looked at elevation and orthoimagery. Other supported services are: nhd, govunits, contours, geonames, NHDPlus_HR, structures, transportation, and wbd. More info here: https://docs.ropensci.org/terrainr/#available-datasets

Let's try elevation and contours this time:

```{r}
with_progress(
  site_tiles <- get_tiles(site_bbox, 
                            output_prefix = "yosemite_np_5m",
                            services = c("elevation", "contours"),
                            resolution = 5)
)

site_tiles
```

Now we can convert the elevation and contour layers to plot with ggplot2. The contours layer is an RGBA multi-band raster layer, similar to the orthoimagery. 

```{r}
elevation <- raster(site_tiles$elevation)
contours <- stack(site_tiles$contours)

# look at structure of contours raster - has 4 layers
contours
```

RGBA has 4 channels: red, green, blue, and alpha. The 4th channel, alpha, is like opacity. In this case, alpha is 0 in cells without contour lines and 1 where contours exist.

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_spatial_rgb(data = contours,
                   mapping = aes(x, y, r = red, g = green, b = blue)) + 
  coord_sf(crs = 4326) + 
  theme_void()
``` 

Contours reflect elevation, so let's make it so! The next chunk stacks elevation and contours together and coverts to a dataframe to plot using `geom_raster` with ggplot2. Then, using the alpha channel, the dataframe is filtered to just the contour lines, and elevation values are used in the color scale.


```{r}
contour_stack <- stack(elevation, contours)
contour_df <- as.data.frame(contour_stack, xy = TRUE)

names(contour_df) <- c("x", "y", "z", "r", "g", "b", "a") # longitude, latitude, elevation, red, green, blue, alpha

contour_lines <- contour_df[contour_df$a != 0, ]

## plot it!
ggplot(data = contour_lines)+
  geom_raster(mapping = aes(x, y, fill = z))+
  theme_void()+
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill="black"),
        plot.title = element_text(color="white"),
        legend.position = "none")+
  coord_sf(crs = 4326)+
  scale_fill_scico(palette="imola", direction = 1)+
  ggtitle(paste("Half dome", site$lat, site$lng))

```


This chart uses the scico package for color scale. Scico (https://github.com/thomasp85/scico) offers a selection of color palettes developed for scientific applications. They are perceptually uniform to represent data fairly, and universally readable by both color-vision deficient and color-blind people. 

```{r}
scico_palette_show() # to see all palette options
```

For the purposes of the workshop, we're avoiding large downloads. But if we were to increase the resolution even more, say to 1m, terrainr might break up the focal region into multiple tiles:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## warning: running this code chunk will take over 5 minutes to complete
with_progress(
  site_tiles_1 <- get_tiles(site_bbox, 
                            output_prefix = "yosemite_np_10m",
                            services = c("elevation", "contours"),
                            resolution = 1)
)

site_tiles_1

```

In which case they can be merged together using `merge_rasters`  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
merge_el <- terrainr::merge_rasters(site_tiles_1$elevation, 
                          tempfile(fileext = ".tif"))

merge_co <- terrainr::merge_rasters(site_tiles_1$contours, 
                          tempfile(fileext = ".tif"))
```

## On your own

```


# Part 4: Unity

This part of the workshop will be performed as a demonstration, rather than a 
tutorial, due to the amount of time it takes to download the data while on video
calls. The code used in the Unity demonstration is below -- fair warning, it 
takes a (very) long time to run!

```{r eval=FALSE}
with_progress(
  output_tiles <- get_tiles(campsite_bbox, 
                            output_prefix = "bryce_canyon_np",
                            services = c("elevation", "ortho"))
)

mapply(
  merge_rasters,
  input_rasters = output_tiles,
  output_raster = paste0(names(output_tiles), ".tif")
)

mapply(
  raster_to_raw_tiles,
  input_file = c("elevation.tif", "ortho.tif"),
  output_prefix = "bryce_canyon",
  raw = c(TRUE, FALSE)
)
```
