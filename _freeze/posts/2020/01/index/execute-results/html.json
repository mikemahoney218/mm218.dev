I \nstarted this package to solve an issue I found myself running into when \nbuilding [flexdashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), and \nhave since found out that there's all sorts of cool tricks you can do by \napplying this type of functional programming mindset to R Markdown documents.\n\nYou can find out more on heddlr's [documentation website](https://mikemahoney218.github.io/heddlr/),\nproudly made in R via [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). This first version \non CRAN is 0.5.0, with 0.1 -> 0.4 previously released on [GitHub](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/heddlr).\n",
