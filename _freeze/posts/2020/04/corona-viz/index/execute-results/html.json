So I grabbed down the John Hopkins CSSE data and made a quick\nShiny app to visualize case and death rates. \nI'm trying to not contribute to \nthe constant noise surrounding the ongoing pandemic, but having a \nway to see these numbers without an overwhelming amount of surrounding \neditorialization has made me feel like I understand the world a bit better.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"covid.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](covid.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n[The app lives at this link](https://mm218.shinyapps.io/corona_data_explore/).\nThanks to R Studio, who are providing free hosting for coronavirus apps through\nthe pandemic.\n",
