So I grabbed down the John Hopkins CSSE data and made a quick\nShiny app to visualize case and death rates. \nI'm trying to not contribute to \nthe constant noise surrounding the ongoing pandemic, but having a \nway to see these numbers without an overwhelming amount of surrounding \neditorialization has made me feel like I understand the world a bit better.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"covid.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](covid.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n[The app lives at this link](https://mm218.shinyapps.io/corona_data_explore/).\nThanks to R Studio, who are providing free hosting for coronavirus apps through\nthe pandemic.\n\n<hr>\n\n<script src=\"https://utteranc.es/client.js\"\n        repo=\"mikemahoney218/mm218.dev\"\n        issue-term=\"url\"\n        label=\"comment\"\n        theme=\"github-light\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async>\n</script>\n",
