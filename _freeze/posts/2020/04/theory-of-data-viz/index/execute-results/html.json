For something so essential to so many people’s daily work,\ndata visualization is so rarely directly taught, and is usually assumed\nto be something people will pick up with time.\n\nHowever, that isn’t the best approach. Data visualization is a skill\nlike any other, and even experienced practitioners could benefit from\nhoning their skills in the subject. Hence, this series.\n\nThis series doesn’t set out to teach you how to make a specific graphic\nin a specific software. I don’t know what softwares might be applicable\nto your needs in the future, or what visualizations you’ll need to\nformulate when, and quite frankly Google exists – so this isn’t a\ncookbook with step-by-step instructions. The goal here is not to provide\nyou with recipes for the future, but rather to teach you what flour is –\nto introduce you to the basic concepts and building blocks of effective\ndata visualizations.\n\n### The mantras\n\nAs much as possible, I’ve collapsed those concepts into four mantras\nwe’ll return to throughout this course. The mantras are:\n\n1.  A good graphic tells a story.\n2.  Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\n3.  Use the right tool for the job.\n4.  Ink is cheap. Electrons are even cheaper.\n\nEach mantra serves as the theme for a section, and will also be\ninterwoven throughout. The theme of this section is, easily enough:\n\n### A good graphic tells a story\n\nWhen making a graphic, it is important to understand what the graphic is\nfor. After all, you usually won’t make a chart that is an exact\ndepiction of your data – modern data sets tend to be too big (in terms\nof number of observations) and wide (in terms of number of variables) to\ndepict every datapoint on a single graph. Instead, the analyst\nconsciously chooses what elements to include in a visualization in order\nto identify patterns and trends in the data in the most effective manner\npossible. In order to make those decisions, it helps a little to think\nboth about *why* and *how* graphics are made.\n\n### Why do we tell a story?\n\nAs far as the *why* question goes, the answer usually comes down to one\nof two larger categories:\n\n  - To help identify patterns in a data set, or\n  - To explain those patterns to a wider audience\n\nThese are the rationales behind creating what are known as,\nrespectively, *exploratory* and *explanatory* graphics. Exploratory\ngraphics are often very simple pictures of your data, built to identify\npatterns in your data that you might not know exist yet. Take for\nexample a simple graphic, showing tree circumference as a function of\nage:\n\n![](theory1.png)\n\nThis visualization isn’t anything too complex – two variables,\nthirty-five observations, not much text – but it already shows us a\ntrend that exists in the data. We could use this information, if we were\nso inspired, to start investigating the *whys* of why tree growth\nchanges with age, now that we’re broadly aware of *how* it changes.\n\nExplanatory graphs, meanwhile, are all about the *whys*. Where an\nexploratory graphic focuses on identifying patterns in the first place,\nan explanatory graphic aims to explain why they happen and – in the best\nexamples – what exactly the reader is to do about them. Explanatory\ngraphics can exist on their own or in the context of a larger report,\nbut their goals are the same: to provide evidence about why a pattern\nexists and provide a call to action. For instance, we can reimagine the\nsame tree graph with a few edits in order to explain what patterns we’re\nseeing:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"theory2.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](theory2.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI want to specifically call out the title here: “Orange tree growth\ntapers by year 4.” A good graphic tells a story, remember. As such,\nwhatever title you give your graph should reflect the point of that\nstory – titles such as “Tree diameter (cm) versus age (days)” and so on\nadd nothing that the user can’t get from the graphic itself. Instead,\nuse your title to advance your message whenever it makes sense –\notherwise, if it doesn’t add any new information, you’re better off\nerasing it altogether.\n\nThe important takeaway here is not that explanatory graphics are\nnecessarily more polished than exploratory ones, or that exploratory\ngraphics are only for the analyst – periodic reporting, for instance,\nwill often use highly polished exploratory graphics to identify existing\ntrends, hoping to spur more intensive analysis that will identify the\nwhys. Instead, the message is that knowing the end purpose of your graph\n– whether it should help identify patterns in the first place or explain\nhow they got there – can help you decide what elements need to be\nincluded to tell the story your graphic is designed to address.\n\n### How do we tell a story?\n\nThe other important consideration when thinking about graph design is\nthe actual *how* you’ll tell your story, including what design elements\nyou’ll use and what data you’ll display. My preferred paradigm when\ndeciding between the possible “hows” is to weigh the *expressiveness and\neffectiveness* of the resulting graphic – as defined by Jeffrey Heer at\nthe University of Washington, that means:\n\n  - **Expressiveness**: A set of facts is expressible in a visual\n    language if the sentences (i.e. the visualizations) in the language\n    express all the facts in the set of data, and only the facts in the\n    data.  \n  - **Effectiveness**: A visualization is more effective than another\n    visualization if the information conveyed by one visualization is\n    more readily perceived than the information in the other\n    visualization.\n\nOr, to simplify:\n\n1.  Tell the truth and nothing but the truth (don’t lie, and don’t lie\n    by omission)\n2.  Use encodings that people decode better (where better = faster\n    and/or more accurate)\n\nKeep this concept in the back of your mind as we move into the mechanics\nof data visualization in our next post – it should be your main\nconsideration while deciding which elements you use\\! We’ll keep\nreturning to these ideas of explanatory and exploratory, as well as\nexpressiveness and effectiveness, throughout the rest of this article.\n\n<hr>\n\n<script src=\"https://utteranc.es/client.js\"\n        repo=\"mikemahoney218/mm218.dev\"\n        issue-term=\"url\"\n        label=\"comment\"\n        theme=\"github-light\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async>\n</script>\n",
