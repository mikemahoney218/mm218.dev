Electrons are even cheaper.\n\nThis is a fancy, dogmatic way to say: Make more than one chart. It’s\nrare that your first try is going to produce your best looking output.\nPlay around with your data set, try out different visuals, and keep the\nconcepts we’ve talked about in mind. Your graphs will be all the better\nfor it. In this section, we’ll talk about solutions to some of the most\ncommon problems people have with making charts:\n\n### Dealing with big data sets\n\nThink back to the diamonds data set we used in the last section. It\ncontains data on 54,000 individual diamonds, including the carat and\nsale price for each. If we wanted to compare those two continuous\nvariables, we might think a scatter plot would be a good way to do\nso:\n\n![](making-1-1.png)\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like 54,000 points is a few too many for this\nplot to do us much good\\! This is a clear case of what’s called\n*overplotting* – we simply have too much data on a single graph.\n\nThere are three real solutions to this problem. First off, we could\ndecide simply that we want to refactor our chart, and instead show how a\nmetric – such as average sale price – changes at different carats,\nrather than how our data is\ndistributed:\n\n![](making-2-1.png)\n\nThere are all sorts of ways we can do this sort of refactoring – if we\nwanted, we could get a very similar graph by binning our data and making\na bar\nplot:\n\n![](making-3-1.png)\n\nEither way, though, we’re not truly showing the same thing as was in the\noriginal graph – we don’t have any indication of the actual distribution\nof our data set along these axes.\n\nThe second solution solves this problem much more effectively – make all\nyour points\nsemi-transparent:\n\n![](making-4-1.png)\n\nBy doing this, we’re now able to see areas where our data is much more\ndensely distributed, something that was lost in the summary statistics –\nfor instance, it appears that low-carat diamonds are much more tighly\ngrouped than higher carat ones. We can also see some dark stripes at\n“round-number” values for carat – that indicates to me that our data\nhas some integrity issues, if appraisers are more likely to give a stone\na rounded number.\n\nThe challenge with this approach comes when we want to map a third\nvariable – let’s use cut – in our graphic. We can try to change the\naesthetics of our graph as\nusual:\n\n![](making-5-1.png)\n\nBut unfortunately the sheer number of points drowns out most of the\nvariance in color and shape on the graphic. In this case, our best\noption may be to turn to option number three and facet our plots – that\nis, to split our one large plot into several small\nmultiples:\n\n![](making-6-1.png)\n\nRemember: Ink is cheap. Electrons are even cheaper. Make more than one\ngraph.\n\nBy splitting out our data into several smaller graphics, we’re much\nbetter able to see how the distribution shifts between our categories.\nIn fact, we could use this technique to split our data even further,\ninto a matrix of scatter plots showing how different groups are\ndistributed:\n\n![](making-7-1.png)\n\nOne last, extremely helpful use of faceting is to split apart charts\nwith multiple entangled lines:\n![](making-8-1.png)\n\nThese charts, commonly referred to as “spaghetti charts”, are usually\nmuch easier to use when split into small\nmultiples:\n\n![](making-9-1.png)\n\nNow, one major drawback of facet charts is that they can make\ncomparisons much harder – if, in our line chart, it’s more important to\nknow that most clarities are similar in price at 2 carats than it is to\nknow how the price for each clarity changes with carat, then the first\nchart is likely the more effective option. In those cases, however, it’s\nworth reassessing how many lines you actually need on your graph – if\nyou only care about a few clarities, then only include those lines, and\nif you only care about a narrow band of prices or carats, window your\ndata so that’s all you show. The goal is to make making comparisons\neasy, with the understanding that some comparisons are more important\nthan others.\n\n### Dealing with chartjunk\n\nCast your mind back to the graphic I used as an example of an\nexplanatory\nchart:\n\n![](making-10-1.png)\n\nYou might have noticed that this chart is differently styled from all\nthe others in this course – it doesn’t have the grey background or grid\nlines or anything else.\n\nThink back to our second mantra: everything should be made as simple as\npossible, but no simpler. This chart reflects that goal. We’ve lost some\nof the distracting elements – the colored background and grid lines –\nand changed the other elements to make the overall graphic more\neffective. The objective is to have no extraneous element on the graph,\nso that it might be as expressive and effective as possible. This\nusually means using minimal colors, minimal text, and no grid lines.\n(After all, those lines are usually only useful in order to pick out a\nspecific value – and if you’re expecting people to need specific values,\nyou should give them a table\\!)\n\nThose extraneous elements are known as *chartjunk*. You see this a lot\nwith graphs made in Excel – they’ll have dark backgrounds, dark lines,\nspecial shading effects or gradients that don’t encode information, or –\nworst of all – those “3D” bar/line/pie charts, because these things can\nbe added with a single click. However, they tend to make your graphics\nless effective as they force the user to spend more time separating data\nfrom ornamentation. Everything should be made as simple as possible, but\nno simpler; every element of your graphic should increase expressiveness\nor effectiveness. In short: don’t try to pretty up your graph with\nnon-useful elements.\n\nAnother common instance of chartjunk is animation in graphics. While\nanimated graphics are exciting and trendy, they tend to reduce the\neffectiveness of your graphics because as humans, when something is\nmoving we can’t focus on anything else. [Check out these examples from\nthe Harvard Vision Lab](http://visionlab.harvard.edu/silencing/) – they\nshow just how hard it is to notice changes when animation is added. This\nisn’t to say you can never use animation – but its uses are best kept to\ntimes when your graphic looking cool is more important than it conveying\ninformation.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\nAs we wind down this section, I want to touch on a few common mistakes\nthat didn’t have a great home in any other section – mostly because we\nwere too busy talking about *good* design principles.\n\n### Dual y axes\n\nChief amongst these mistakes are plots with two y axes, beloved by\ncharlatans and financial advisors since days unwritten. Plots with two y\naxes are a great way to force a correlation that doesn’t really exist\ninto existence on your chart, through manipulation of your units and\naxes. In almost every case, you should just make two graphs – ink is\ncheap. Electrons are even cheaper.\n\nFor an extremely entertaining read on this subject, [check out this\nlink](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2016/01/16/two-y-axes/).\nI’ve borrowed Kieran’s code for the below viz – look at how we can\nimply different things, just by changing how we scale our\naxes\\!\n\n![](making-11-1.png)\n\n### Overcomplex visualizations\n\nAnother common issue in visualizations comes from the analyst getting a\nlittle too technical with their graphs. For instance, think back to our\noriginal diamonds scatter plot:\n![](making-12-1.png)\n\nLooking at this chart, we can see that carat and price have a positive\ncorrelation – as one increases, the other does as well. However, it’s\nnot a linear relationship; instead, it appears that price increases\nfaster as carat increases.\n\nThe more statistically-minded analyst might already be thinking that we\ncould make this relationship linear by log-transforming the axes – and\nthey’d be right\\! We can see a clear linear relationship when we make\nthe\ntransformation:\n\n![](making-13-1.png)\n\nUnfortunately, transforming your visualizations in this way can make\nyour graphic hard to understand – in fact, only about [60% of\nprofessional\nscientists](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0610-7?WT.feed_name=subjects_ecology)\ncan even understand them. As such, transforming your axes like this\ntends to reduce the effectiveness of your graphic – this type of\nvisualization should be reserved for exploratory graphics and modeling,\ninstead.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAnd that just about wraps up this introduction to the basic concepts of\ndata visualizations. Hopefully you’ve picked up some concepts or\nvocabulary that can help you think about your own visualizations in your\ndaily life. I wanted to close out here with a list of resources I’ve\nfound helpful in making graphics – I’ll keep adding to this over time:\n\n  - When picking colors, I often find myself reaching for one of the\n    following\n        tools:\n      - [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&scheme=BrBG&n=5)\n        provided most of the palettes for these graphics\n      - [ColorSupply](https://colorsupplyyy.com/) makes picking custom\n        colors\n        easier\n      - [Viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html)\n        provides beautiful, colorblind-friendly palettes for use (though\n        this resource is a little harder to understand)\n  - I used the following resources in putting this post together:\n      - [Hadley Wickham’s Stat 405 Course](http://stat405.had.co.nz/),\n        particularly the lecture on [effective\n        visualizations](http://stat405.had.co.nz/lectures/20-effective-vis.pdf)\n        (I’ve lifted “perceptual topology should match data toplogy”,\n        “make important comparisons easy”, and “visualization is only\n        one part of data analysis” directly from his slides)\n      - [Jeffrey Heer’s CSE 442 lecture on\n        visualizations](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse442/17au/lectures/CSE442-VisualEncoding.pdf),\n        particularly the definitions for expressiveness and\n        effectiveness\n\n\n<hr>\n",
