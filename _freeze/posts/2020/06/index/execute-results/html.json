If you wanna.\"\nauthor:\n  - name: Mike Mahoney\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n---\n\n\nA while back, I made a [tweetbot](https://twitter.com/ecology_tweets) that \nretweets a set of ecology-related hashtags, in order to signal boost ecology \ncontent in a similar manner to [statsbot](https://twitter.com/statstwitbot) or\n[Plotter Bot](https://twitter.com/PlotterTweeter). The code to do this is pretty\nsimple -- made almost trivial by the [rtweet](https://rtweet.info/) package -- \nbut I found that environmental hashtags have a pretty low signal-to-noise \nratio, driven down by various political and industry groups, as well as trolls.\n\nI didn't want to get into the business of content filtering, so instead I started\nlooking for other markers that a tweet was -- or wasn't -- worth promoting, and \nhave gotten to what I believe is a respectable place with my filtration. So I've\n[open-sourced the code](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/retweet_bot/tree/master)\n(without the specific values I use to filter) for anyone else who might be \ninterested in setting up their own automated retweet app.\n\n",
