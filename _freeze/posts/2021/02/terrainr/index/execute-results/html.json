I've been working through the comments over\nthe past week or so, and today that work has culminated in the release of \nterrainr version 0.3.0.\n\nThis is a big release with a handful of breaking changes, so I felt like I \nshould give a brief overview of the biggest user-facing changes.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n### Object Classes Are Dead; Long Live Object Classes\n\nThe single largest change is that \n*terrainr specific classes are no longer exported*, and users shouldn't need to \nworry about getting data into or out of those formats anymore. Instead, use \nany `sf` or `Raster` object in their place. For instance, workflows that used to \nlook like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Doesn't run:\nlibrary(terrainr)\nsimulated_data <-  data.frame(id = seq(1, 100, 1),\n                              lat = runif(100, 44.04905, 44.17609), \n                              lng = runif(100, -74.01188, -73.83493))\n\nbbox <- get_bbox(lat = simulated_data$lat, lng = simulated_data$lng) \n\noutput_tiles <- get_tiles(bbox = bbox,\n                          services = c(\"elevation\", \"ortho\"),\n                          resolution = 90)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow look like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(terrainr)\nsimulated_data <-  data.frame(id = seq(1, 100, 1),\n                              lat = runif(100, 44.04905, 44.17609), \n                              lng = runif(100, -74.01188, -73.83493))\n\nsimulated_data <- sf::st_as_sf(simulated_data, coords = c(\"lng\", \"lat\"))\nsimulated_data <- sf::st_set_crs(simulated_data, 4326)\n\noutput_tiles <- get_tiles(data = simulated_data,\n                          services = c(\"elevation\", \"ortho\"),\n                          resolution = 90)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs part of this change, `get_bbox`, `get_coordinate_bbox`, and all class \ncreation and export functions are gone now. Use sf (or Raster*) objects in their\nplace instead.\n\n### New Names, Who This?\n\n`get_tiles` now uses the `services` argument to name its output list:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnames(output_tiles)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"elevation\" \"ortho\"    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis means that if you request the service `elevation` you can retrieve your \ntiles using the name `elevation`. If you request the same endpoint with \nmultiple names, `get_tiles` will use whatever name was first in the vector.\n\n### Fewer Utilities, More Useful\n\nUtility functions `calc_haversine_distance`, `convert_distance`, \n`point_from_distance`, `rad_to_deg`, and `deg_to_rad` have been removed (or \nremoved from exports). For unit conversions, check out the \n[units](cran.r-project.org/package=units) package. This shouldn't impact the \nmain uses of the package, but is still worth flagging. \n\n## Show Me What You Got\n\nterrainr 0.3.0 adds a ggplot2 geom, `geom_spatial_rgb`, for plotting 3 band RGB\nrasters:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_spatial_rgb(data = output_tiles[[\"ortho\"]],\n                   # Required aesthetics r/g/b specify color bands:\n                   aes(x = x, y = y, r = red, g = green, b = blue)) + \n  coord_sf(crs = 4326)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that above we just passed the file path to our raster; we can also pass a \nRasterStack:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\northo <- raster::stack(output_tiles[[\"ortho\"]])\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_spatial_rgb(data = ortho,\n                   aes(x = x, y = y, r = red, g = green, b = blue)) + \n  coord_sf(crs = 4326)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOr a data.frame: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\northo_df <- raster::as.data.frame(ortho, xy = TRUE)\nnames(ortho_df) <- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"red\", \"green\", \"blue\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_spatial_rgb(data = ortho,\n                   aes(x = x, y = y, r = red, g = green, b = blue)) + \n  coord_sf(crs = 4326)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that each step here gives you a little more control over the output image \n-- for instance, if your raster bands aren't in RGB order (or you have more than\nRGBA bands), you'll need to provide a data.frame to get a true color image. \n\nYou can then use these basemaps like most other ggplot geoms:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() + \n  geom_spatial_rgb(data = ortho_df,\n                   aes(x = x, y = y, r = red, g = green, b = blue)) + \n  geom_sf(data = simulated_data) + \n  coord_sf(crs = 4326)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## New Docs, Who This?\n\nThose are just a few of the changes in 0.3.0; you can find a longer list in the\nNEWS file. \n\nOne thing not mentioned in the\n[NEWS](https://mikemahoney218.github.io/terrainr/news/index.html) file, though, \nis that this version of terrainr included a complete rewrite of the \ndocumentation. The docs were mostly written while the package was being \nconceptually developed, and as a result gave a bit too much emphasis to some \nideas while completely ignoring others. So I've rewritten all of the \ndocumentation that lives on the \n[terrainr website](https://mikemahoney218.github.io/terrainr/) -- let me know\nwhat you think about the new versions (or if you catch anything I've missed!).\n",
