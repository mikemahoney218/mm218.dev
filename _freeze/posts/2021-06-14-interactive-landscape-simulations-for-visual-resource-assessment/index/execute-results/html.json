Users can interactively walk around the landscape to see for themselves if the viewshed algorithm gets things exactly right.](closer.jpg){width=886}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis was a really fun project, forcing me to push these visualizations in a new \ndirection. The conference itself is in October, and I've posted a preprint of \nthe paper [at this link](https://www.mm218.dev/papers/vrs_2021.pdf).\n\n[Update - 2021-06-24] And the code and manuscript used for this paper are now on\n[Github at this link](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/vrs2021).\n",
