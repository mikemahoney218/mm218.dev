Right: Where terrainr gets you.](fig1.png){width=1571}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe JOSS workflow is absolutely fascinating. I made a \n[git branch in the terrainr repo](https://github.com/ropensci/terrainr/tree/paper) \nwith the files needed to generate the paper, then (through a web form) opened a\n[pre-review issue on GitHub](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/4055).\nThe editors used that issue to assign a handling editor, then moved things over to\n[a review issue](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/4060), where\nthe paper was processed and prepared for submission via an \n[automatically generated PR](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-papers/pull/2885).\nThe whole thing was incredibly efficient, and also entirely transparent -- the logs of\nthe paper processing workflow will be available until GitHub finally shuts down, a \nrefreshing change compared to standard peer review.\n\nThe paper itself is a general overview of the terrainr package, trying to \nbe a new enough contribution that it's not just repeating the package documentation \nbut not adding enough to spin off into\n[an entirely separate research project](https://www.mm218.dev/posts/2021-06-14-interactive-landscape-simulations-for-visual-resource-assessment/).\nIt's also very short -- a nice feature of JOSS papers -- so rather than summarize here I'll just\nsuggest you [read it yourself](https://www.mm218.dev/papers/terrainr_2022.pdf).\n",
