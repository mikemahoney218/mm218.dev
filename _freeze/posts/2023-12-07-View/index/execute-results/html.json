I have no idea why. Does this have to do with functions that are not just dealing with some sort of standard output? #rstats\"}\n\nMy first thought on reading this was that `View()` in RStudio is built to mask the `View()` function from utils, and so capitalizes the V because utils capitalized the V. Things are the way they are because they are the way they are, yet again.\n\nBut of course, that's not the actual question -- not only did David specify he's talking about the function in _R_, not in _RStudio_, but of course someone decided that utils should capitalize the `View()` function as well. And this is weird! There are not that many functions in base R that start with a capital letter:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetOption(\"defaultPackages\") |> \n  setdiff(\"datasets\") |> \n  vapply(\\(x) paste0(\"package:\", x), character(1)) |> \n  ls() |> \n  strsplit(\"\") |> \n  Filter(f = \\(x) x[[1]] %in% LETTERS) |> \n  vapply(paste0, character(1), collapse = \"\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"Rprof\"               \"Rprofmem\"            \"RShowDoc\"           \n [4] \"RSiteSearch\"         \"Rtangle\"             \"RtangleFinish\"      \n [7] \"RtangleRuncode\"      \"RtangleSetup\"        \"RtangleWritedoc\"    \n[10] \"RweaveChunkPrefix\"   \"RweaveEvalWithOpt\"   \"RweaveLatex\"        \n[13] \"RweaveLatexFinish\"   \"RweaveLatexOptions\"  \"RweaveLatexSetup\"   \n[16] \"RweaveLatexWritedoc\" \"RweaveTryStop\"       \"Stangle\"            \n[19] \"Sweave\"              \"SweaveHooks\"         \"SweaveSyntaxLatex\"  \n[22] \"SweaveSyntaxNoweb\"   \"SweaveSyntConv\"      \"URLdecode\"          \n[25] \"URLencode\"           \"View\"               \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese functions all follow one of three patterns:\n\n+ Functions that start with `R` or `S`, capitalized because it's the name of a programming language; \n+ Functions that start with URL;\n+ `View()` _by itself_!\n\n**Update:**\n\nA few minutes after publishing, [Konrad Rudolph points out on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@klmr@mastodon.social/111540097245999105) that there are plenty of functions in the base package _itself_ that are capitalized and don't match these rules:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nls(\"package:base\") |> \n  strsplit(\"\") |> \n  Filter(f = \\(x) x[[1]] %in% LETTERS) |> \n  vapply(paste0, character(1), collapse = \"\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"Arg\"                     \"Conj\"                   \n [3] \"Cstack_info\"             \"Encoding\"               \n [5] \"Encoding<-\"              \"F\"                      \n [7] \"Filter\"                  \"Find\"                   \n [9] \"I\"                       \"Im\"                     \n[11] \"ISOdate\"                 \"ISOdatetime\"            \n[13] \"La_library\"              \"La_version\"             \n[15] \"La.svd\"                  \"LETTERS\"                \n[17] \"Map\"                     \"Math.data.frame\"        \n[19] \"Math.Date\"               \"Math.difftime\"          \n[21] \"Math.factor\"             \"Math.POSIXt\"            \n[23] \"Mod\"                     \"NCOL\"                   \n[25] \"Negate\"                  \"NextMethod\"             \n[27] \"NROW\"                    \"OlsonNames\"             \n[29] \"Ops.data.frame\"          \"Ops.Date\"               \n[31] \"Ops.difftime\"            \"Ops.factor\"             \n[33] \"Ops.numeric_version\"     \"Ops.ordered\"            \n[35] \"Ops.POSIXt\"              \"Position\"               \n[37] \"R_compiled_by\"           \"R_system_version\"       \n[39] \"R.home\"                  \"R.version\"              \n[41] \"R.Version\"               \"R.version.string\"       \n[43] \"Re\"                      \"Recall\"                 \n[45] \"Reduce\"                  \"RNGkind\"                \n[47] \"RNGversion\"              \"Summary.data.frame\"     \n[49] \"Summary.Date\"            \"Summary.difftime\"       \n[51] \"Summary.factor\"          \"Summary.numeric_version\"\n[53] \"Summary.ordered\"         \"Summary.POSIXct\"        \n[55] \"Summary.POSIXlt\"         \"Sys.chmod\"              \n[57] \"Sys.Date\"                \"Sys.getenv\"             \n[59] \"Sys.getlocale\"           \"Sys.getpid\"             \n[61] \"Sys.glob\"                \"Sys.info\"               \n[63] \"Sys.localeconv\"          \"Sys.readlink\"           \n[65] \"Sys.setenv\"              \"Sys.setFileTime\"        \n[67] \"Sys.setLanguage\"         \"Sys.setlocale\"          \n[69] \"Sys.sleep\"               \"Sys.time\"               \n[71] \"Sys.timezone\"            \"Sys.umask\"              \n[73] \"Sys.unsetenv\"            \"Sys.which\"              \n[75] \"T\"                       \"UseMethod\"              \n[77] \"Vectorize\"              \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne of those is `Filter()`, which I _literally used in the original code chunk_ and somehow didn't notice started with a capital letter.\n\n< / update >\n\nBut even with that said, `View()` is the only function _in recommended packages_ that starts with a capital letter that's not named after a proper noun.^[[Merriam-Webster calls \"URL\" a noun](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/URL), even if it originated as an acronym, get out of my comments.] And it's been weird for a long time. The original version of the function was also capitalized when it was added by Professor Brian D Ripley way back in 2007:\n\n![](commit.png){fig-alt=\"Commit by Prof. Brian D Ripley on Feb 19 2007, adding the capitalized `View()` function.\"}\n\nNow here's where we enter the world of wild speculation. Because if we look at the documentation for `View()`, we can see that this function is meant to \"Invoke a Data Viewer\", with \"Data Viewer\" capitalized like a proper noun in both the function title and description:\n\n![](ViewDoc.png){fig-alt=\"The rd documentation file for `View()`. Notably, the Description field capitalizes the phrase Data Viewer.\"}\n\nThis isn't a universal style. If we look for instance at the documentation for `edit()`, which pre-dates `View()`,^[Though I'm not sure who originally wrote it; I get a bit lost in the VCS logs from before base functions were split into sub-packages.] we can see that \"text editor\" is capitalized in the title but not in the description:\n\n![](EditDoc.png){fig-alt=\"The rd documentation file for `edit()`. Notably, the Description field _does not_ capitalize the phrase text editor.\"}\n\nSo this makes me suspect that Data Viewer here is being used as a proper noun. This wouldn't be a unique usage; for instance, the [RStudio user guide also describes its viewer as a Data Viewer, capitalized](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/data/data-viewer.html), and a search for \"Data Viewer\" suggests the phrase is capitalized something like 2/3 of the time on public websites. I have absolutely no knowledge of the tech jargon of 2007, or of the proper styling of \"data viewer\",^[And I assume these two things are related!] but it does seem like it's _sometimes_ a proper noun.\n\nSo, to wildly speculate just a little further: is `View()` capitalized because \"Viewer\" was capitalized, at least back in 2007?\n\nNow, here's a decent piece of evidence _against_ this conjecture: the details section of the `View()` documentation, added at the same time as the title and description,^[And the function itself; all of this documentation is also still in the official help file.] doesn't capitalize the phrase \"data viewer\":\n\n![](ViewDetails.png){fig-alt=\"The details section of the `View()` documentation. Data viewer is not capitalized.\"}\n\nThat said, this is also not unique. That same [RStudio user guide also sometimes writes \"data viewer\" in lowercase](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/data/data-viewer.html#scrolling), though in _most_ of the guide it's treated as a proper noun.\n\nSo there's one guess: maybe `View()` is capitalized because, like the functions starting with R and S and URL, it's named after a proper noun. Things are the way they are because they are the way they are, yet again.\n\nIf anyone knows more, though -- or feels like asking Professor Ripley -- please drop me a line. I'd love to know the actual answer.\n",
